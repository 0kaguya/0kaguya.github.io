This is Kaguya's personal blog. To anyone knows or don't know about me, it's all welcomed.

I was born in China, that to say I'm not English native. It's very likely to be Chinese posts here. That could be hard Chinese that I can't express myself in English.

In school I'm learning Computer Science, including trival math and physics. Since work experience is pure blank, I'm focus on self establishment. That's a wide range of scope.
