http://http://mmix.cs.hm.edu/ provides a rich content of MMIX, the underlying language in Knuth's TAOCP.
They also provide assembler and instruction level simulator to run mmix code. I see someone packaged them
into arch's AUR but I'm current on SUSE and have no idea about package maintenance in this system. So I
just download them and put them into .bin and all.
