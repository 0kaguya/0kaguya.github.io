A frastrating title but anyway this blog, of course, will continues. The thing
is, after a couple of years, I regain my energy to focus on this side of my
life. I'm carefully reviewing what I have done yet and what I have missed. Lot of
things got given up and a lot have picked up.

I feel more and more like a middle aged man who just found something new but his
body, his missing youth stops him from every corner. He feels his shame when learning
the abcs the basics. I'm not trying to hide this feeling. I don't have the right
to say the word "talent" anymore.

The blog will update as frequently as possible everytime I have enough materials on
any specific topic.
